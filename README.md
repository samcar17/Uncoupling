# Uncoupling
Archival repo of my first proper audio programming project. Made for a uni course on ChucK.[^1]  

The Uncoupling class, see `UncouplingClass.ck`, can be used for a variety of sample splitting tasks, most of which include a degree of aleatoricism. Included is a demonstration composition which (IIRC) uses all the featurs to make something vaugely house/techno oriented.

Arguably more sonically interesting demos of this code can be found [here](https://youtu.be/_Y4DkZmrcEQ) and [here](https://succulentkeeper.bandcamp.com/track/succulent-keeper).  

[^1]: Please forgive the poorly named variables and bad "jazzschool" humour, this is very old code and I was young and dumb lol.
